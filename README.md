# C-OnlineShop-application-Software-design
This involves designing a software solution, then programming the software solution in C#.

# Design a software solution
The solution covers the standard 3-layer architecture.

1.	Data storage at the lower layer (e.g., storage to SQL-DB, JSON file or XML file).
2.	Domain logic in the middle. You are free to choose the domain the program will handle.
3.	Console-based front end. (Not much focus on UI appearance, it is not part of the curriculum. But there must be a logical and user-friendly front end, it is part of planning and design.)

# The solution contains at least 2 projects:

### •	C# Console App
### •	C# NUnit Test Project



# Report
1.	Techniques and tools for collaboration, such as pair programming and version control.
2.	UML class diagram.
3.	C# .NET's modern features
4.	Description of the SOLID principles
5.	Layering. 
6.	Design patterns
7.	Multithreading and/or event-based code
8.	Testing: Unit tests
9.	Refactoring.
